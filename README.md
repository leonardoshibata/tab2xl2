# tab2xl2
Stata program similar to tab2xl but for two-way tabulations. Allows column and row relative frequencies.

## Change log:
* **version 0.0.2 (02mar2016)** - major rewrite in this version. Since the aim is to write tab2xl2 so it generates excel files almost ready for publishing, I decided to changed the table presentation. Now column or row percentages are shown side by side of frequencies, as opposed to under it. Also corrected a bug pointed by Bryan.



* **version 0.0.1 (12jan2016)** - based on tab2xl http://blog.stata.com/2013/09/25/export-tables-to-excel/
